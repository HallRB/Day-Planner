Daily planner will show the date and time as of when it was last refreshed by the user.

Within the planner will be slots to write down plans for the day in 1 hour intervals from 8am - 5pm to compensate for an average 8 hour work day with a 1 hour lunch.

The text slots will also show whether the current time has passed a time slot's defined time period by darkening a slot while leaving slots whose times are after the current time a lighter shade.

If a user enters information and clicks the corresponding save button adjacent to the particular submitted text, that information will be saved in the local storage so it remain available even after the window is closed.
