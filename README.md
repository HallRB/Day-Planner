# Unit 05: Third-Party APIs

## Purpose
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Instructions
Daily planner will show the date and time as of when it was last refreshed by the user.

Within the planner will be slots to write down plans for the day in 1 hour intervals from 8am - 5pm to compensate for an average 8 hour work day with a 1 hour lunch.

The text slots will also show whether the current time has passed a time slot's defined time period by darkening a slot while leaving slots whose times are after the current time a lighter shade.  If the current time is between two specific hours, it will be shaded a unique blue to indicate this is the present time.

If a user enters information and clicks the corresponding save button adjacent to the particular submitted text, that information will be saved in the local storage so it remain available even after the window is closed.
